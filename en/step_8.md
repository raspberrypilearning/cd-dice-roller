## Challenge: more than 6 sides

Some games have unique dice that are not cubes. They have more/less than 6 sides. Edit your Dice Roller so the user can select the number of sides your dice will have. (Don't worry about using the dice images, just use the actual numbers like you did at the start of this project.)
