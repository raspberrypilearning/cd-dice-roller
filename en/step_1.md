## Introduction

Create an online dice roll simulator with JavaScript code that you can use instead in games such as Monopoly, Yahtzee, or Liar's Dice.

### What you will make

You will build a web app like the one in the trinket below.

<div class="trinket">
  <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/html/568648e665?outputOnly=true&amp;start=result" width="600" height="505" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

To use the simulator, click on the drop-down menu and select the number of dice you want to roll. Then click on **Roll Dice**. To keep some dice and roll the other ones again, click on the dice you want to keep so they turn yellow. Then click **Roll but Keep Selected Dice**. Click on **Liars Dice** or **Yahtzee** to learn the rules of these games.
