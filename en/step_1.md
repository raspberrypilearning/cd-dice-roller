## Introduction

Create a dice roll simulator using JavaScript that you can use instead of real dice in a variety of games, including Monopoly, Yahtzee, or Liar's dice.

### What you will make

You will build a web app like the one in the trinket below.

<div class="trinket">
  <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/html/568648e665?outputOnly=true&amp;start=result" width="600" height="505" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

To use the dice simulator, select the number of dice you wish to roll using the drop-down `select` button. Then click 'Roll Dice'. If you want to keep some dice from your roll and roll the other ones again, click the dice you wish to keep and they will turn yellow. You can then click 'Roll but Keep Selected Dice'. Click on 'Liars Dice' or 'Yahtzee' to learn more about these games!
