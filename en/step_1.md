## Introduction

Create a dice roll simulator using Javascript that you can use instead of real dice in a variety of games including monopoly, yahtzee or liars dice.

### What you will make

Build a web app like the one in the trinket below.

<div class="trinket">
  <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/html/d99b53620d?outputOnly=true&amp;start=result" width="600" height="505" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

Select the number of dice you wish to roll using the drop down `select` button. Then click 'Roll Dice'. If you want to keep some dice from your roll and roll the other ones again, click the dice you wish to keep, they will turn yellow and you can click 'Roll but Keep Selected Dice'. Click on 'Liars Dice' or 'Yahtzee' to learn more about these games!
